# ELeFHAnt
Ensemble Learning for Harmonization and Annotation of Single Cells (ELeFHAnt) provides an easy to use R package for users to annotate clusters of single cells, harmonize labels across single cell datasets to generate a unified atlas and infer relationship among celltypes between two datasets. It provides users with the flexibility of choosing a single machine learning based classifier or letting ELeFHAnt automatically use the power of  randomForest and SVM (Support Vector Machines) to make predictions. It has three functions 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship.
